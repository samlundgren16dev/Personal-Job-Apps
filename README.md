## Configuration

The application creates a `config/` directory with user settings:
- Excel file path
- Window preferences
- Backup settings
- Browser configuration

## Performance Improvements

| Feature | Improvement | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Browser Pooling | ~60% faster | Reuse browser instances instead of creating new ones |
| Excel Caching | ~80% faster | Keep workbook in memory, reduce file I/O |
| Async Parsing | Better UX | Non-blocking job parsing with progress indicators |
| Auto-save | Data safety | Periodic saves prevent data loss |
| Batch Operations | Bulk efficiency | Process multiple records simultaneously |

## Technical Architecture

### **Design Patterns**
- **MVC Architecture** - Clean separation of GUI, business logic, and data
- **Observer Pattern** - Event-driven updates between components
- **Factory Pattern** - Browser instance management and creation
- **Singleton Pattern** - Configuration and resource management
- **Command Pattern** - Menu actions and keyboard shortcuts

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Lazy Loading** - Components loaded only when needed
- **Connection Pooling** - Efficient browser resource management
- **Caching Strategy** - Multi-layer caching for Excel and web data
- **Async Operations** - Non-blocking UI during web scraping
- **Memory Management** - Automatic cleanup and garbage collection

### **Web Scraping Engine**
- **Multi-site Support** - Handles major job platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, company sites)
- **Anti-bot Protection** - User-agent rotation and request throttling
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Content Parsing** - BeautifulSoup + Selenium for dynamic content
- **Data Validation** - Automatic verification of extracted information

## Advanced Usage

### **Menu Options**
- **File Menu**: New job, Export/Import CSV, Backup data
- **Edit Menu**: Edit/Delete jobs, Search, Refresh
- **View Menu**: Statistics, Clear terminal
- **Help Menu**: Keyboard shortcuts, About

### **Statistics Dashboard**
- Total application count
- Top 5 companies by application count
- Top 5 locations by application count
- Recent applications tracking

### **Data Export/Import**
- Export to CSV for external analysis
- Import existing data from CSV files
- Automatic data validation during import

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **ChromeDriver not found**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup.py  # Re-run setup to download ChromeDriver
   ```

2. **Job parsing fails**
   - Website structure may have changed
   - Check internet connection
   - Try editing the job entry manually

3. **Excel file locked**
   - Close Excel if you have the file open
   - Application will show error message with guidance

4. **Performance issues**
   - Clear browser cache by restarting application
   - Check available disk space for backups
   - Reduce browser pool size in configuration

### **Debug Mode**
The terminal window shows detailed logs for troubleshooting. Common messages:
- `Green text`: Successful operations
- `Yellow text`: Warnings or retries
- `Red text`: Errors that need attention
